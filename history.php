            headquarters of the school from 1926 until its closure
            by the Nazi Party in 1932.

          Walter Gropius founds the Bauhaus, wanting "to create a new guild of
          craftsmen, without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant
          barrier between craftsman and artist." The school merges the Weimar
          Academy of Fine Art and the Weimar Saxon Grand Ducal Art School.

          The Bauhaus shuts down its Weimar campus, and moves to Dessau.  The

          Political pressure from the Nazi party forces the Bauhaus campus in
          Dessau to be shut down.  As an attempt to keep the school
          functioning, Mies selects a former telephone factory as a new campus.

          The Gestapo raids the beleaguered school in April, and in July
