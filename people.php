        <h2>People of the Bauhaus</h2>
        <p>
        Here is a smattering of notable members of the Bauhaus.
        While there are too many to include in this project, I have
        attempted to give a brief look at the range of participants.
        </p>

          <p>
          Walter Gropius was the founder of the Bauhaus in 1919.
          His goal was "to create a new guild of craftsmen, without
          the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier
          between craftsman and artist." He remained involved with
          the Bauhaus throughout its life, and bounced through
          various artists' circles after its closure.
          </p>
          <p>
          As with many other members of the school, he settled
          outside of Europe after its demise.

          Head of the Bauhaus' carpentry department, Marcel Breuer
          was the creator of many famous pieces of modernist
          furniture.  His career in architecture after the Bauhaus,
          centered in New York, would further cement his legacy.
          Works include IBM La Gaude, the Met Breuer, the headquarters
          of UNESCO, and many more buildings which extended modernism
          into the brutalist style.

          <p>
          Lucia Moholy was the serially undercredited photographer
          and editor who documented the Bauhaus.  She worked as
          part of the <span lang=de>Neue Sachlichkeit</span>, or
          New Objectivity, movement as she cataloged the school's
          facilities and projects.  This distinctive style's
          documentary focus on the truth can be seen in her frank
          self-portrait.
          </p>
          <p>
          She was forced to leave behind the bulky glass negatives
          of her photos when she fled Berlin upon the rise of the
          Nazi Party, and these original copies of her work were
          subsequently held by Walter Gropius.  She was able to
          recover most by the 1960s, but only after struggling to
          have her photographs recognized as her own in Bauhaus
          publications.

          Margaretha Reichardt, also known as Grete, was a weaver
          and textile artist from Erfurt, Germany.  A member of the
          Bauhaus from 1926 to 1931, she was one of the most important
          members of the weaving workshop.  From commercially-produced
          toys to airplane seats, her works embodied the importance
          the school placed on the crafts, as well as practicality
          in all they produced.

          Both colleague and competitor of Gropius, Mies would begin his career
          in the modernist style outside of the Bauhaus.  His directorship
          began in 1930 at Gropius' insistence, but could not protect the
          faltering school from rising Nazi opposition to modernist art.
          <br>
          He saw much success after emigrating to the United States, spending
          the rest of his career based at his Chicago studio.

          <dd>
          Wassily Kandinsky is considered a pioneer of abstract art.  He joined
          the Bauhaus in the midst of his career, teaching from 1922 until the
          school's closure in 1933.
