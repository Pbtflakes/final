        Founded in Germany in 1919, as the merger of two arts schools, the
        <span lang=de>Bauhaus Staatliches</span> was a school which combined
        arts education with practicing of crafts, and pioneered modernist
        design.

        Its members taught in disciplines ranging from color theory to
        carpentry to weaving, always working to break down the separation
        between artist and craftsperson.  This would ultimately bring about
        persecution from the Nazi Party as they rose to power, forcing the
        school to scatter.  However, its influence refused to die as its former
        members taught and worked around the world.
